undergradResearchPaper - Undergraduate Research Paper
======================

On Blender and OpenVDB. Last term paper presented in order to obtain my undergraduate degree (text in Portuguese). 

This is the last term paper presented in order to obtain my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering at UFSCar (www.ufscar.br).
The document, written in TeX, discusses my development efforts on the Google Summer of Code 2013 program working on Blender. 

The paper contains several images owned by their respective authors and used for illustration purposes only. 

The document is published openly so it can aid others with the TeX formatting, or for other students at the same institution who wants a template for their documents.

Rafael.
